### [Amazon AWS SaaS Sales Dataset](https://github.com/adamghozi/amazon-aws-saas-sales-dataset)

Provides an overview of the analysis conducted on the AWS SaaS Sales dataset. Utilizing Python and related packages such as Jupyter, matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodels, and SciPy, the analysis is presented in the form of a Jupyter notebook. The dataset consists of transactional data from Amazon Web Service (SaaS) company specializing in sales and marketing software for business-to-business (B2B) clients, comprising 9,994 transactions. The dataset encompasses various columns, including unique identifiers for transactions and orders, order dates, customer details, product information, sales amounts, quantities, discounts, and profits. Key insights derived from descriptive statistics and correlation analyses reveal notable relationships between sales, quantities, discounts, and profits. Additionally, the examination of profit discrepancies across subregions and products highlights areas for further investigation, particularly regarding the correlation between profit and discount multiplied by sales in specific subregions and product categories.
