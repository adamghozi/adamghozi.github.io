## Learning Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Car Rental Data Management Project]((https://github.com/adamghozi/car-rental-data-management))

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
